            <h3 class="color_blue">problem</h3>
              <p>
                There are very many finance apps on the market. 
                However, most of them focus on general finances and stock market transactions. 
                The user is also often expected to know about finances and independently invest money for individual wishes. 
                There is no accessible app that focuses on savings and teaches the topic to financial newbies in a simple and motivating way.
              </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-6">
            <h3 class="color_blue">solution</h3>
            <p>
              To ensure easy navigation through the app, users are familiarized directly with the most important functions with a onboarding after the login. 
              This allows users to set savings goals quickly and without barriers. Created savings goals can be viewed on the main page and edited at any time. 
              Since the app can be used as an advisor, tips are provided on all aspects of finance and saving. 
              To reach the savings goal with an ease, motivational notifications are shown at regular intervals.

          After creating the high fidelity wireframes in greyscale I proceeded
          with the design of the final UI. First I designed the <strong> grow brand
          guidelines.</strong> This sets out all the guidelines of the brand, ensuring
          consistency across all channels.

      <div class="row-case">
        <h4 class="color_blue">colours</h4>
        <p>
          The color palette of grow consists of different blue tones which
           <strong>communicate security and trust.</strong> They are combined with dynamic accent
          colours. These colours help to develop joy and fun in finance.

        <h4 class="color_blue">typography</h4>
        <p>
          The type font of grow is <strong>Poppins.</strong> Poppins is a sans serif typeface. It
          looks solid and thus <strong> conveys confidence and security.</strong> Especially in
          finer font families, it creates a feeling of lightness.

      <div class="row-case">
        <h4 class="color_blue">logotype</h4>
        <p>
          Our logo grow is a protected word mark and must always be written in
          lower case. The “w” additionally visualizes a rising, positive course.
          On the one hand grow stands for the <strong>growing savings</strong> that can be
          reached with the help of the app, and on the other hand for the <strong>growing knowledge</strong> of the user.

        <p>
          To maintain the integrity of the brand it is important to present the
          wordmark in the best possible way in terms of contrast and legibility.
          The examples demonstrate acceptable usages and colour combinations.

              The colours from the style guide were not applied consistently at
              the beginning. It took a few iterations until the colour
              consistency was right, and the user guidance became clear.</li>
            <li>
              From the first user feedback, it became clear that the user
              guidance was still very confusing. In the next iterations, the
              complexity was broken down and simplified. In the future, user
              surveys should always be conducted before user flows and
              wireframes are developed to save time and costs.

              Nothing went unusually wrong with this project. Through quick
              feedback from my users and frequent calls with my mentor, I was
              able to avoid major mistakes.
