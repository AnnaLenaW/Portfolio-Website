<h2>overview</h2>
<p>grow is a responsive web app that users can always use, no matter where they are and what device they have available. 
grow promotes a conscious approach to money. Moreover, grow helps to ensure that financial dreams do not just remain dreams but become reality.</p>

<h2>context</h2>
<p>The brief was to design a responsive web app for people who don't like working with their finances. 
The user requires that the information they receive via the tool is easily accessible, and clear. The users' primary goal is to save a certain amount of money for a special purpose in a certain time. 
The tool itself can provide financial advice during the periods of saving.</p>

<h2>objective</h2>
<p>The aim of the app is to familiarise users directly with the most important functions of the user interface so that they can easily find their way around. 
This makes it possible to create savings goals quickly and without barriers. Created savings goals are immediately visible and can be edited at any time. 
As the app can be used as an advisor, tips are given on all aspects of finance and saving.</p>

<h2>User Flows</h2>
<p>As a user, I need to be able to tell the tool what my saving goal is 
and how long I have to reach it, so that I can save accordingly.</p>

<p>As a user, I want the money-saving tool I use to be motivational, so I stay on track with my goals.</p>

<h2>Mid fidelity Wireframes</h2>
<p>I tested my mid fidelity wireframes on 5 test users.
<br>
    <h4>Information for my test users</h4>
    grow is a tool that helps you save money easily and quickly. 
    With the help of a savings plan, you can save money for a special purpose in a certain period of time. </p>
   <div></div> <h4>Scenario</h4>
    You need a new mountain bike for next summer. 
    It costs 1,500 € and you have 12 months to save for it. 
    Please create a savings plan to reach this goal.

    I prioritize them based on their level of necessity (critical or nice-to-have).</p>

        <li>Definitely don't use "You dont know". 
        It comes across rude or like your babying the user. Error rating: 3</li>
        <li>Confirmation screen: Edit option would be nice. 
        Maybe an option like return home, create new budget, view my library. Error rating: 3</li>

    <li>The font size in the CTA for Sign up is a bit large. Error rating: 3</li>
    <li>Little dropdown icon in the date input field and dd/mm/yy instead of date. Error rating: 3 </li>
    <li>The budget input field looks a little bit like a button.  BUDGET can be smaller and off to the left of the field. Error rating: 2</li>
    <li>Back chevron icon looks too big. Error rating: 2</li>

<h2>feedback analysis</h2>
<p>
    <li>First I have to focus only on my user flow “crating a saving goal”</li>
    <li>Fix errors on the login page</li>
    <li>It must be possible to finish the setup faster - users are unsatisfied if they have to click through categories</li>
    <li>Setting the time period for the savings goal must be flexible so that the user can better estimate the amount to be saved.</li>
    <li>The savings goal must be editable</li>
    <li>Use consistent wording</li>

<h2>high fidelity wireframes</h2>
<p>After I analysed the user feedback and prorised it in the error rating, I moved on to the high fidelity wireframes. 
    These were further kept in greyscale to ensure intuitive usability.</p>

<h2>style guide</h2>
<p>After creating the high fidelity wireframes in greyscale I proceeded with the design of the final UI. 
    First I designed the grow brand guidelines. This sets out all the guidelines of the brand, ensuring consistency across all channels.</p>

<h3>colours</h3>
<p>The color palette of grow consists of different blue tones which communicate security and trust. 
    They are combined with dynamic accent colours. These colours help to develop joy and fun in finance.</p>

    <img src="img/grow/desktop/grow_09_colours@1x.png" alt="My Image">
</picture>


<h3>typography</h3>
<p>The type font of grow is Poppins. Poppins is a sans serif typeface. 
    It looks solid and thus conveys confidence and security. Especially in finer font families, it creates a feeling of lightness.</p>


<h3>logotype</h3>
<p>Our logo grow is a protected word mark and must always be written in lower case. The “w” additionally visualizes a rising, positive course. 
    On the one hand grow stands for the growing savings that can be reached with the help of the app, and on the other hand for the growing knowledge of the user.</p>

    <img src="img/grow/desktop/grow_logotype_contrast@1x.png" alt="My Image">
</picture>
<p>To maintain the integrity of the brand it is important to  present the wordmark in the best possible way in terms of contrast and legibility. 
    The examples demonstrate acceptable usages and colour combinations.</p>



<h2>final UI design</h2>
<p>After creating the brand guidelines, I applied the guidelines to my high fidelity wireframes and designed the final UI in Figma.</p>

<h2>retrospective</h2>

    <h3>What went well</h3>
    <li>The development of the brand style went well.</li>
    <li>The feedback from the users has been good.</li>
    <li>Watching several tutorials has been worthwhile. My skills in Figma are improving. I gained a good knowledge of components.</li>
    <li>This time I had a better time management. I was able to finish the project easier and faster.</li>
    
    
    <h3>What went wrong</h3>
    <li>Nothing went unusually wrong with this project. 
        Through quick feedback from my users and frequent calls with my mentor, I was able to avoid major mistakes.</li>



    <h3>What can be improved</h3>
    <li>The colours from the style guide were not applied consistently at the beginning. 
        It took a few iterations until the colour consistency was right, and the user guidance became clear.</li>
        <li>From the first user feedback, it became clear that the user guidance was still very confusing. In the next iterations, the complexity was broken down and simplified. 
            In the future, user surveys should always be conducted before user flows and wireframes are developed to save time and costs.</li>
